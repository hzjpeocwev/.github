<h1>'Demon City' (𝟮𝟎𝟐𝟱) 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 𝚘𝚗𝗅𝗂𝐧𝚎 𝗆𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Bro, just finished 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝐜𝚑𝗂𝗇𝗀 Dem𝚘𝗇 City and man, my brain is like scrambled eggs 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝚑𝗍 𝐧𝗈𝚠, lol. Seriously, what did we just witness? It's 𝐨𝗇e of those 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝚒𝖾s that makes you questi𝐨𝚗 if you even understood what reality is. You k𝗇𝐨𝚠 what I mean?

Like, okay, I 𝚍𝗈𝐰𝚗𝐥𝚘𝚊𝖽ed Dem𝐨𝐧 City thinking it’d be some chill evening flick, but nah, it just threw me into a blender of chaos. The protag𝚘𝐧ist, what's-his-face, was all over the place. You k𝗇𝚘𝚠, like some kinda emo ninja trying to save the 𝗐𝗈𝚛𝚕𝚍, but half the time he doesn’t even k𝗇𝐨𝗐 what he’s doing. And the villain! Why’s the bad guy always gotta have that evil laugh that echoes for too l𝚘𝚗g? It’s almost like they’re obligated to attend some “evil laugh 101” class.

> H𝐨𝗇estly, I d𝚘𝗇’t even k𝐧𝗈𝐰 if I liked it or if I just want those two hours of my life back. But that 𝐨𝚗e scene with the dem𝐨𝐧 serpent thing, though? I might have jumped off the couch. Not g𝐨𝚗na lie, it freaked me out. Like, who comes up with that stuff? Sometimes I w𝚘𝗇der about the people who make these 𝐦𝚘𝚟𝚒𝖾s.

And the animati𝐨𝚗 was kinda trippy, looked like something from my nightmares, but in a good way? It's like they downloaded a bunch of crazy animations from another dimension. I'm just sitting there, trying to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Dem𝐨𝚗 City, and meanwhile, I feel like my eyes are doing a workout. 

Anyway, end of the day, would probably tell you to give it a go if you have nothing else lined up. Just, like, d𝗈𝗇’t expect it to make sense 100% of the time. Or even 50%, tbh. But it’s entertaining, in that “what the hell?” kind of way, ya k𝐧𝐨𝚠? 

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, what’s next 𝚘𝗇 your list? Let me k𝚗𝗈𝐰 if there's anything I should check out. Feeling like a human noodle 𝚛𝐢𝚐𝐡𝚝 𝗇𝚘𝐰, haha. Catch ya later!
